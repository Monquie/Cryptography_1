    "* Now that we know how two users can protect data using a shared secret key, the next question is how did these two users generate a shared secret key to begin with? This question will take us into the world of **public key cryptography.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* So imagine for a second that there a N users in the world. And the question is, how do these users manage these secret keys that they're gonna use to communicate with one another? So, for example, let's assume N equals four and there are four users in the world. One option is that basically every pair of users will share a shared secret key. And so, for example, U1 and U3 will share a shared, a shared secret key. I'll call it K13. U1 and U2 will share a, a shared secret key. We'll call it K12 so on and so forth. K24 K34 and so on and so forth. K14 and finally K23. The problem with this approach is that now there are many, many shared keys that users have to manage. And in particular, every user has to store on the order of N keys if he's gonna talk to N other parties in this world. So the question is can we do any better than storing N keys per user? And the answer is yes. And one way to do that is what's called an online trusted third party. I'll use TTP to denote that trusted third party. So the way we are going to use the trusted third party is every user will now share a single key with this trusted third party. So user one will share a secret key, user two will share a secret key. And here are our friends Alice and Bob, let's call their secret keys k sub A and k sub B. \n",
    "    * Okay, so now the nice thing about this design is that now every user only has to remember one secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The question is now, what happens when Alice wants to talk to Bob? Somehow the two of them have to engage in a certain protocol, such that at the end of this protocol they will have a shared secret key KAB that the attacker wouldn't be able to know.\n",
    "    * And so the question is how do Alice and Bob generate this shared secret key KAB.\n",
    "* So here we have our friends Alice and Bob. As usual Bob has his key KB, which is shared with a trusted third party. Alice has her secret key KA, which is also shared with a trusted third party. So here the trusted third party has both KA and KB. And the question is, how do they generate a shared key that they both agree on, but the attacker would have no idea what this shared key is? So here we're only gonna look at a toy protocol. In particular, this protocol is only gonna to be secure against eavesdropping. It's not gonna be secure against more tampering or active attacks.\n",

    "* So in other words, adversary that listens to the conversation won't know what the shared key KAB is gonna be. And so the protocol works as follows. Alice is going to start by sending a message to the trusted third party saying, hey I want a secret key that's going to be shared with Bob. What the trusted third party will do is it will actually go ahead and choose a random secret key, KAB. So the trusted third party is the one who's gonna generate their shared secret key. And what it will do with this key is the following. It's gonna send one message back to Alice. But this message consists of, of two parts. The first part of the message is an encryption using Alice's secret key, using the key KA, of the message this key is supposed to be used between parties Alice and Bob, and she includes the secret key KAB inside the message. Okay? So just to be clear, what's happening here is that the message that gets encrypted is the key KAB plus the fact that this key is supposed to be a shared key between Alice and Bob. Okay. And this whole message is encrypted using Alice's secret key. The other part of the message that the TTP sends to Alice is what's called a ticket. And this ticket is basically a message that's encrypted for Bob. So in other words, the ticket is gonna be an encryption under the key KB of, again, the fact that this key is supposed to be used between Alice and Bob. And she concatenates to that the, the secret key, KAB. Okay, so again, the message that's encrypted inside of the ticket is the fact that this key is to be used by Alice and Bob. And, the secret key, KAB, is included in the ticket as well. Okay, So these two messages, Here, let me circle them. These two messages are sent from the trusted third party to Alice. Now I should mention that the encryption system E that is actually being used here is a CPA secure cipher and we'll see why that's needed in just a minute. So, this is the end of the conversation between Alice and this trusted third party. Basically as we said at the end of this conversation, Alice receives one message that's encrypted for her and another message called a ticket that's encrypted for Bob. Now at a later time when Alice wants to communicate securely with Bob what she will do, is of course, she will decrypt her part of the message. In other words she will decrypt the cipher text that was encrypted using the key KA and now she has the key KAB. And then to Bob, she's going to send over this ticket. Bob is going to receive the ticket and he is going to use his own secret key KB to decrypt it and then he himself will also recover the secret key KAB. So now they have the shared secret key KAB that they can use to communicate securely with one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **And the first question to ask is, Why is this protocol secure? Even if we only consider eavesdropping adversaries.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* What does an eavesdropper see in this protocol. Well basically he sees these two cipher texts. Right, he sees the cipher text that's encrypted for Alice. And then he sees the ticket that's encrypted for Bob. And in fact he might see many instances of these messages, in particular if Alice and Bob continuously exchange keys in this way he's gonna see many messages of this type and our goal is to say that he has no information about the exchanged key KAB. So this follows directly from the CPA security of the cipher E D because the eavesdropper can't really distinguish between encryptions of the secret key KAB from encryption of just random junk. That's the definition of CPA security and as a result, he can't distinguish the key KAB from, you know, random junk which means that he learns nothing about KAB. This is kind of a very high level argument for why this is eavesdropping security but it's enough for our purposes here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Now let's think about the TTP for a minute.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* So first of all, you notice that the TTP is needed for every single key exchange. So basically Alice and Bob simply cannot do key change unless the TTP is online and available to help them do that. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* And the other property of this protocol is in fact, the TTP knows all the session keys. So if somehow the TTP is corrupt, or maybe it's broken into, then an attacker can very easily steal all the secret keys that have been exchanged between every user of this system. This is why this TTP is called the Trusted Third Party because, essentially, it knows all the session keys that have been generated in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nevertheless the beauty of this mechanism is that it only uses symmetric key cryptography, nothing beyond what we've already seen and as a result it is very fast and efficient. The only issue is that you have to use this online trusted party and it's not immediately clear if for example we wanted to use this in the world wide web who would function as this online trusted third party. However, in a corporate setting this might actually make sense if you have a single company with a single point of trust it might make sense to actually designate a machine as a trusted third party. And in fact a mechanism like this not quite as the way I described it, but a mechanism like this is the basis of the Kerberos system. \n",

    "* Can we generate shared keys without an online TTP ?\n",
    "\n",
    "* And this is, in fact, the starting point of public cryptography. So I'm gonna show you three ideas for making this happen and we're gonna talk about them in much more detail in the, in the coming modules. So the first idea is actually due to Ralph Merkle back in 1974. This was, he was, when he was just an undergraduate student. And already he came up with this really nice idea for key exchange without an online trusted third party. So that's one example that we're gonna look at. Another example is due to Diffie and Hellman. Back in 1976 they both actually, working here at Stanford University, came up with this idea that launched the world of modern key cryptography. And the third idea is due to Rivest, Shamir and Adleman working at MIT and we're going to look in detail exactly how each of these ideas work. But I do want to mention that the work on public key management hasn't stopped in the late seventies. In fact there have been many ideas over the years and here I'll just mention two from the last decade. One is call identity based encryption, which is another way for managing public keys. And another is called functional encryption, which is a way of giving secret keys that only partially decrypt a given cipher text.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this segment we're going to look at our first key exchange protocol without a trusted third party\n",
    "\n",
    "* So the settings are, we have our friends Alice and Bob as usual. And these friends have never met before but somehow they want to generate a shared key. So what they're going to do is they're going to send messages to one another, back and forth. And this time there is no trusted third party that they can communicate with. And at the end of this protocol, somehow they should have a shared key that they both know\n",
    "\n",
    "* So there's a secret key k that they both know. But an eavesdropper who listens in on this traffic has absolutely no idea what this secret key k is. For now we're just going to worry about attackers that only eavesdrop on the conversation. In other words, we don't allow any tampering with traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* And the first question, though, for this segment, is \"Can this be done only using symmetric crypto?\" So can this only be done using block ciphers or hash functions, or any of the tools that we've seen in the last four weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * And so very surprisingly, the answer is \"Yes\", in fact we can do key exchange just using block ciphers or hash functions without a trusted third party but unfortunately the resulting protocols are very inefficient and are actually never used in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><span class=\"girk\">So the simple protocol I want to show you what's called a **Merkle Puzzles protocol.**</span></h3> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main tool for this protocol is what's called a \"puzzle\" and let me explain what I mean by a puzzle. A puzzle is a problem that's difficult to solve, but can be solved with some effort. In other words, if you really put your mind to it you can solve it. So let me give an example. Suppose we have a symmetric cipher that uses keys that are 128 bits long So just think of AES for example. And suppose what I do is a choose an AES key such that the first 96 bits are all 0 and only the remaining 32 bits are non-zero and just chosen at random. Ok, so only 32 bits of this 128-bit key are random. The rest are all 0. And now what I do is I encrypt a fixed plaintext, for example, simply the plaintext \"message\" using this 128-bit key that happens to be mostly 0. The result is what I would call a \"puzzle\". The reason I call it a puzzle is because it's actually not that hard to find the secret key P simply by trying all 2-to-the-32 possibilities. Remember the first 96 bits are all 0, there are only 2-to-the-32 possible keys to try. And for each key we'll try to decrypt this puzzle and see if we get the plaintext \"message\". If so, we know that we've recovered the right solution, P. So within 2-to-the-32 work, we can actually solve this puzzle. Namely, we can find P just given puzzle(P).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img  src=\"Screen Shot 2017-01-25 at 11.52.41.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* So in a diagram the way this protocol works is as follows: Alice starts off by sending 2-to-the-32 puzzles to Bob. So we can generalize this. Let's say that she says n puzzles to Bob. And lets say that each puzzle takes work proportional to n to solve. Bob solves one of these puzzles, and then he sends back x-j to Alice. So far each one of them has spent work n. And then Alice basically looks up puzzle x-j and recovers the key that corresponds to this puzzle. And as a result both of them now have a shared key that they can use to communicate with one another. Ok so lets look at the work they did. So the work that Alice did is that she had to prepare n puzzles. Well, preparing the puzzle takes constant time. She had to prepare n puzzles, so her work is roughly order n. Bob chose one puzzle and solved it, so his work is also proportional to order n. So linear in n. Let's see what the eavesdropper has to do. Well the poor eavesdropper sees these n puzzles go by and then he sees this x-j come back. And he doesn't really know which puzzle Bob actually solved. All he sees is this random value inside of the puzzle. And so to break this protocol, the eavesdropper would actually have to solve all puzzles until he finds the right puzzle that has the value x-j in it, and then he will recover k-j. So my question to you is, \"What is the attacker's work?\" How much work did the eavesdropper have to spend in order to break this protocol. So the answer is, of course, order n-squared. You know, quadratic time in n. He had to solve n puzzles. Each puzzle takes time n to solve. And as a result he had to spend time order n-squared. In our example we said that there were 2-to-the-32 puzzles and each one took 2-to-the-32 time to solve, so overall the attacker's work is roughly 2-to-the-64 steps. So you can see the problem with this protocol. First of all, the participants Alice and Bob had to do quite a bit of work themselves. If you think about it, Alice basically had to send 2-to-the-32 puzzles to Bob. That's many. many gigabytes that she had to send to Bob. Like 16 or 32 gigabytes, depending on how big each puzzle is. Bob had to spend time 2-to-the-32 to solve one of these puzzles. That would take a few seconds, too. But then, all the security they got is that the attacker can break this protocol in time 2-to-the-64. So 2-to-the-64 is still not considered particularly secure. As a result, the attacker, really, if he really wanted to break this protocol, he could. So to make this secure, the participants would have to increase the parameter n. And they would have to send, say, 2-to-the-64 puzzles to one another, and then spend time 2-to-the-64 to solve each puzzle, and then the attacker's work would be 2-to-the-128, which is considered secure. But having the participants spend time 2-to-the-64 to set up a secure session is a little bit too much to ask each of these participants. So this is why this protocol is not particularly used in practice. But nevertheless there's a really nice idea here in that the participants had to spend linear time, whereas the attacker had to spend quadratic time. So there's a \"quadratic gap\" between the amount of work that the participants had to do, versus what the attacker had to do to break the protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "* And so the question is what to do next. So now we're kind of stuck. We said that with block ciphers, we really can't do better than a quadratic gap. And so what do we do? So this was kind of the starting point of public-key cryptography. And the realization is that we need more than just generic block ciphers and generic hash functions. We actually need functions that have very, very special properties. And to build these functions, we actually have to rely on some algebra. So in the next few segments we're going to look at some algebraic constructions and then we'll see how to use those for key exchange and for many other things in public-key cryptography. \n",

    "# Deffie-Hellman Protocol - Key Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this segment, we're gonna look at the Diffie-Hellman protocol, which is our first practical key exchange mechanism. So let me remind you of the settings. Our friends here, Alice and Bob, have never met and yet they wanna exchange a shared secret key that they can then use to communicate securely with one another. In this segment and the next, we're only gonna be looking at eavesdropping security. In other words, we only care about eavesdroppers. The attackers are actually not allowed to tamper with data in the network. They're not allowed to inject packets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* So as I said in the previous segment we can't achieve this exponential gap from blog ciphers like AES or SHA-256. We have to use hard problems that have more structure than just those symmetric primitives. And so instead what we're gonna do is use a little bit of algebra.\n",

    "* Informal description of the deffie-helman protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **STEP 1 :** What we're gonna do is, **first** of all, we're gonna fix some large prime which I'm gonna call **p**. Actually p I'll usually use to **denote primes**. And you should be thinking of really gigantic primes. Like, primes that are made up of 600 digits are so. And just for those of you who like to think in binary, a *600 digit prime roughly corresponds to about 2000 bits.* So just writing down the prime takes about **two kilo bits of data.**\n",
    "    * **STEP 2 :** And then we're also gonna fix an **integer g** that happens to live in the range one to p.\n",
    "    * **So these values p and g are parameters of the Diffie-Hellman protocol. They are chosen once and they're fixed forever. **\n",
    "* Now the protocol works as follow. So here's our friends Alice and Bob. So what Alice's going to do is she's gonna starts off by choosing some random number a in the range 1 to p-1 And then she is gonna compute the number g to the power of a modulo p. Okay, so she computes this exponention, and reduces the result modular the prime p. And we're actually going to see how to compute this efficiently the next module, so for now just believe me that this computation can be done efficiently. Now, let's call capital A the result of this value. So, what Alice will do is she will send capital A over to Bob. Now Bob is going to do the same thing. He's going to choose a random number b in the range 1 to p-1. He's going to compute g to the b module of p and let's call this number B and he's going to send this number B over to Alice. So Alice sends A to Bob. Bob sends B. To Alice. And now they claim that they can generate a shared secret key. So what's a shared secret key? Well, it's defined as. Let's call it K<u>AB. And it's basically defined as the</u> value g to the power of a times b. Now the amazing observation of Diffie-Hellman had back in 1976 is that in fact both parties can compute this value g to the ab. So let's see, Alice can compute this value because she can take her value B that she received from Bob. She can take this value B, raise it to the power of a and, let's see, what she'll get is g to the b to the power of b. And by the rules of exponentiation, g to the power of b to the power of a is equal to g to the ab. Bob turns out, can do something similar, so his goal is to compute g to the a to the b, which again, is g to the ab, so both Alice and Bob will have computed K<u>AB, and</u> let me ask you, how does Bob actually compute this quantity g to the ab? Well so all he does is he takes the value A that he received from Alice and he raises it to his own secret b and that gives him the shared secret g to the ab. So you can see now that both parties even though they seemingly computed different values. In fact they both end up with the same value namely g ab module p.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **So you notice that what makes this protocol works is basically properties of exponentiation. Namely that, g to the b to the power of a is the same as g to the a to the power of b, okay? These are just properties of exponentiations.** \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **The bigger question is why is this protocol secure?**\n",
    "    * In other words, why is it that an eavesdropper cannot figure out the same shared key due to the AB that both Alice and Bob computed by themselves? So let's analyze this a little bit, then, like I said, we're gonna do a much more in-depth analysis next week. But, let's, for now, just see intuitively why this protocol is gonna be secure. Well, what does the eavesdropper see? Well, he sees the prime and the generator. These are just fixed forever and everybody knows who they are. He also sees the value that Alice sent to Bob, namely this capital A. And he sees the value that Bob sent to Alice, namely this capital B. And the question is, can the, can the eavesdropper compute g to the ab just given these four values? So more generally, what we can do is we can define this Diffie-Hellman function. So we'll say that the Diffie-Hellman function is defined based on some value g. And the question is given g to the a, and g to the b. Can you compute g to the ab? And what we're asking is how hard is it to compute this function module over very large prime p. Remember p was something like 600 digits. So the **real question we need to answer is how hard is this, is this Diffie-Hellman function?**\n",

    "\n",
    "* So here I roll down the table that kind of shows you the rough difficulty of breaking down the Diffie-Hellman protocol compared to the difficulty of breaking down a cipher with a appropriate number of bits. For example, if your cipher has 80 bit keys. That would be roughly comparable to using 1,000 bit modules. In other words breaking a cipher with 80 bit keys takes time roughly 2 to the 80 which means that breaking if you have Diffie-Hellman function with a 1,000 bit module will take time 2 to the 80. If your cipher uses 128 bit keys like AES, you should be really using a 3,000 bit modulus, even though nobody really does this. In reality people would use 2,000 bit modulus. And then if your key is very large, like if we're using a 256 bit AES key, then in fact your modulus needs to be very, very large. Again, you, you can really see the cube root effect here. We doubled the size of our key and because of the cube root effect, what that means is we have to increase the size of, of our modulus by a factor of two cubed, namely a factor of eight, which is where this 15,000 comes from. from. And again I should mention there's not exactly a factor of eight because of the extra constants in the exponent. So this is a nice table that shows you that if you're gonna be using Diffie-Hellman to exchange, a session key. And that session key is gonna be used for a block cipher with a certain key size, this table shows you what modular size you need to use so that the security of the key exchange protocol is comparable to the security of the block cipher you're gonna be using after. Now this last row should really be disturbing to you. I should tell you that working with such a large modulus is very problematic. This is actually gonna be quite slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **So the question is whether there is anything better that we can do?**\n",
    "* And it turns out there is. In fact the way I describe the Diffie-Hellman function is I describe it at the way Diffie and Hellman described it in 1976 using arithmetic module of primes. The problem with arithmetic modular primes is that the Diffie-Hellman function is hard to compute, but it's not as hard as you'd like. There's this cube root effect that makes it a little easier than what you'd really like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **And so the question is can we run the Diffie-Hellman protocol in other settings.**\n",
    "* And it turns out the answer is yes. In fact we can literally translate the Diffie-Hellman protocol from an arithmetic model of primes to a different type of algebraic object and solving the Diffie-Hellman problem on that other algebraic object is much, much harder. This other algebraic object is what's called an elliptic curve. And as I said, computing the Diffie-Hellman function on these elliptic curves is much harder than computing the Diffie-Hellman modulo primes. Because the problem is so much harder, now we can use much smaller objects in particular, you know we'd be using primes that are only a 160 bits or 80 bit keys or only 512 bits for 256 bit keys. So because these module don't grow as fast on elliptic curves, there's generally a slow transition away from using module arithmetic, to using elliptic curves. \n",

    "* So as usual I wanna show that this beautiful protocol that I just showed you, the Diffie-Hellman protocol, is as is, is actually completely insecure against an active attack. **Namely, it's completely insecure against what's called the man in the middle attack.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Okay. So let's see why the protocol that I just showed you is insecure against active attacks. Well suppose we have this man in the middle that's trying to eavesdrop on the conversation between Alice and Bob. Well so, the protocol starts with Alice sending g to the a over to Bob. Well, so the man in the middle is gonna intercept that and he's gonna take the message that Alice sent and he's gonna replace it with his own message. So it's called A', And let's write that is g to the a'. Okay? So the man in the middle chooses his own a' and what he sends to Bob is actually g to the a'. Now poor Bob doesn't know that the man in the middle actually did anything to this traffic, all he sees is he got the value A'. As far as he knows, that value came from Alice. So what is he gonna do in response? Well, he's gonna send back his value B out which is g to the b back to Alice. Well again the man in the middle is gonna intercept this B. He's gonna generate his own b' and what he actually sends back to Alice is B' which is g to the b'. Okay, now what happens? Well Alice is gonna compute her part of the secret key and she's gonna get g to the ab'. Bob is gonna compute his part of the secret key and he's gonna get g to the b times a'. Okay, these now you notice these are not the same keys. In the man in the middle because he knows both A' and B' he can compute both g to the ab' and g to ba'. Yeah it's not difficult to see the man in the middle knows both values. And as a result, now he can basically play this man in the middle and when Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob the man in the middle can simply decrypt this message because he knows the secret key that Alice encrypted message with, re-encrypt it using Bob's key. And then send the message on over to Bob. And this way Alice sent the message, Bob received the message. Bob thinks the message is secure. But in fact that message went through the man in the middle. The man in the middle decrypted it, re-encrypted it for Bob. At the same time he was able to completely read it, modify it if he wants to, and so on. So, the protocol becomes completely insecure give n a man in the middle.\n",

Alright so everybody just writes down you know g to the a, g to the b, g to the c and so on. Now the interesting thing about this is, if say Alice and Charlie wanna set up a shared key they don't need to communicate at all. Basically Alice would go and read Charlie's public profile. Charlie would go and read Alice's public profile. And now, boom, they immediately have a secret key. Namely, now, Alice knows, g to the c and a. Charlie knows g to the a and с. And as a result, both of them can compute п to the ac. So, in some sense, once they've posted their contributions to the Diffie-Hellman protocol to their public profiles, they don't need to communicate with each other at all to set up a shared key. They immediately have a shared key and now they can start communicating securely through Facebook or not with one another. And notice that this is true for any Facebook user. So as soon as I read somebody's public profile, I immediately have a shared key with them without ever communicating with them. This property is sometimes called a non-interactive property of the Diffie-Hellman. So now, let me show you an open problem. And this is an open problem that's been open for ages and ages and ages. So it'd be really cool if one of you can actually solve it. The question is, can we do this for more than two parties? In other words, say we have four parties. All of them post their values to their Facebook profiles. And now we'd like to make it that just by reading Facebook profiles, all of them can set up a shared secret key. In other words, Alice is, what she'll, she'll do is she'll only read the public profiles of, the three friends, Bob, Charlie and David. And already she can compute a shared key with them. And similarly David is just gonna read the public profile of Charlie. Bob and Alice. And already he has a shared key with all four of them. Okay, so the question is whether we can kind of setup non-interactively these, these shared keys for groups that are larger than just two people. So as I said, for n equals two, this is just a Diffie-Hellman protocol. In other words, if just two parties want to set up a shared key without communicating with one another, that's just Diffie-Hellman. It turns out, for N equals three, we also know how to do it, there's a known protocol, it's called protocol due to Joux. It already uses very, very fancy mathematics, much more complicated mathematics than what I just showed you. And for N equals four, or five, or anything above this, above four, this problem is completely open. Nearly the case where four people post something to the public profiles and then everybody else reads the public profile and then they have a joint shared key, this is something we don't know how to do even for four people. And this is a problem that's been open for ages and ages, it's kind of a fun problem to think about and so see if you can solve it, if you will, it's instant fame in the crypto world. \n",

And the decryption algorithm is given a different key, we'll call it a secret key, that also belongs to Bob. So these two keys are sometimes called a key pair. One half of the pair is the public key, and the other half of the pair is the secret key. \n",

And then when the cipher text is given to the decryption algorithm, the decryption algorithm basically outputs the corresponding message. So as I said, PK is called the public key, and SK is called the secret key. So more precisely, what is public key encryption? Well, public key encryption is actually made up of three algorithms, G, E, and D. Algorithm G is what's called the key generation algorithm. When you run algorithm G, it will output two keys, the public key and the secret key. The encryption algorithm basically, given the public key in a message, will output the corresponding cypher text, and the decryption algorithm, given the secret key in the cypher text, will output the message or it will output bottom if an error occurred. \n",

And then the challenger will give him the encryption of m0 or m1. As usual, we define two experiments, experiment zero and experiment one. In experiment 0, the adversary is given the encryption of m0, in experiment 1, the adversary is given the encryption of m1. And then the adversary's goal is to guess which encryption he was given. Was he given the encryption of m0, or was he given the encryption of m1? \n",
    "* And we refer to his guess as the output of experiment zero or experiment one. One thing I wanna emphasize is that in the case of public key encryption, there's no need to give the attacker the ability to mount a chosen plain text attack. Why is that? Well, in the case of a symmetric key system, the attacker had to request the encryption of messages of his choice. In the case of a public key system, the attacker has the public key and therefore, he can by himself encrypt for himself any message that he wants. He doesn't need the challenger's help to create encryptions of messages of his choice. And as a result, in a public key settings, a chosen plaintiff attack is inerrant. There's no reason to give the attacker extra power to mount a chosen plain text attack. And that's why we never discuss chosen plaintiffs' queries in the context of defining semantic security for public key systems. Now that we've defined the game, we're gonna say that a public key system, GED, is semantically secure. It's basically, the attacker cannot distinguish experiment zero from experiment one. In other words, the adversary's probability of opening one and experiment zero is about the same as its probability of opening one in experiment one. So again, the attacker can't tell whether he was given the encryption of m0 or the encryption of m1.\n",

    "* I want to emphasize that this protocol is very different from the Diffie-Hellman protocol that we saw in the last segment in the sense that here, the parties have to take turns, in the sense that Bob cannot send his message until he receives the message from Alice. \n",
    "* In other words, Bob cannot encrypt x to Alice's public key until he receives the public key from Alice. In a Diffie-Hellman protocol, however, the two parties could send their messages at arbitrary times, and there was no ordering enforced on those messages. \n",
    "* As a result, we have this nice application of Diffie-Hellman where everybody could post their messages to Facebook, for example, and then just by looking at Facebook profiles, any pair would already have a shared key without any need for additional communication. Here this is not quite true, even if everybody posts their public keys to Facebook, there would still be a need to send this message before a shared key can be established. \n",

    "* So in this protocol, the attacker gets to see the public key and the encryption of x under the public key, and what he wants to get is basically this value x. Now we know that the system, the public use system that we used, is semantically secure. What that means is that the attacker cannot distinguish the encryption of x from the encryption of something random. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In other words, just given the encryption of x, the attacker can't tell whether the plain text is x or just some random junk that was chosen from M. And because of that, that basically says that, just by looking at messages in this protocol, the value of x is indistinguishable in the attacker's view from a random element in M. And as a result, x can be used as a session key between the two parties. It's just a random value which the attacker cannot actually guess other than by trying all possible values of M. And I should say that showing that these two distributions are distinguishable follow directly from semantic security, and in fact this is a simple exercise to show that if the attacker could distinguish this distribution from that distribution, then the attacker could also break semantic security. And as usual, even though this protocol is secure against eavesdropping, it's completely insecure against the man-in-the-middle attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **So let's see a simple man-in-the-middle attack.**\n",
    "* Well, so here we have Alice generating her public key, secret key pair. At the same time the man in the middle is still going to generate his own public key, secret key pair. Now when Alice sends her public key over to Bob, the man in the middle will intercept that and instead he'll say, yeah this is a message from Alice, but Alice's public key really is really pk prime. \n",
    "\n",
    "* So now Bob will receives this message. He thinks he got a message from Alice. What he'll send back is, well, he's gonna choose his random x, and he'll send that encryption of x under pk prime. The man in the middle is gonna intercept this message, and is gonna replace it with something else. So his goal is to make sure that the key exchange succeeds. In other words, Alice thinks that she got a message from Bob, and yet the man in the middle should know exactly what the exchange secret is. So what should the man in the middle send to Alice in this case? \n",
    "* So here, let's call this cypher text C. What the man in the middle will do, is he will decrypt the cypher text C, using his own sequence key. And that will reveal x to the man in the middle. And then he's gonna go ahead and encrypt x under Alice's public key, send the value back to Alice. Alice will obtain this x and as far as she's concerned, she just did a key exchange with Bob where both of them learned the value x. But the problem, of course, is that the man in the middle also knows the value x. \n",
    "* So this protocol becomes completely insecure once the man in the middle can tamper with messages from Alice to Bob and from Bob to Alice. \n",

    "\n",
    "* So from here on I'm going to use the following notation. I'm going to use capital N to always denote a positive integer, and I'm going to use lower case p to always denote a positive prime number. Now I'd like to introduce the following notation, there's this funny Z that's written like two diagonal lines here with a subscript N I'm gonna use that to denote the sets as zero, one, two, up to N minus one. This is actually a very common notation that's used in Crypto, and so I'll stick to that here. So again, Z sub N denotes the set of integers 0,1 up to N-1. And in fact, this is not just a set of integers. We can do addition and multiplication in this set as long as we always multiply module of the number N. For those of you who know a little bit of algebra, I'll just say that Z sub N denotes a ring where addition and multiplication are done modulo N. This is very common notation in crypto, although in modern mathematics Z sub N sometimes denotes something else. But as I said I'm gonna keep on using Z sub N to denote the set of integers 0 to N-1 with addition and multiplication modulo N. So I want to make sure everybody's comfortable with modular arithmetic. And so let's just look at the number, say, N=12 And let's just see some basic facts about modular arithmetic. So I'm gonna say that nine plus eight is seventeen; seventeen is five modulo twelve, so I'm gonna write that nine plus eight is equal to five in Z 12. Now can someone tell me how much is five times seven in Z12? In other words, how much is modular 12? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Well, five times seven is 35. And if you recall, 36 is divisible by 12 So five times seven is really -1 module of 12. 35 is minus one module of twelve. But minus one module of 12 is basically the same as 11, cuz I just add 12 to -1 and I get 11. And the next question is, how much is 5 - 7 seven in the Z12? Well, 5-7 is -2. -2 modulo 12, well, I just add 12 to -2 and I get 10. As a result, we say that 5 - 7 is equal to 10. So again, this is just to make sure everybody is comfortable with this notation of working in Z12. In other words, working in modulo 12. Now, I'd just like to make a general statement that, in fact, arithmetic in ZN, in other words, arithmetic modulo N works just as you would expect. So, for example, all the laws that you know about addition and multiplication work equally well in ZN. For example, the distributive law, X times Y plus Z, is still gonna be equal to X times Y plus X times Z. So many of the things that you know about arithmetic when working over the integers or in the reals, will translate to working in, ZN, namely working modulo N.\n",

    "* So the next concept we need is what's called a greatest common divisor, or a GCD. And so suppose they give you two integers X and Y. We say that the GCD of X and Y is basically the greatest common divisor it's the largest number, the largest integer that divides both X and Y. So for example, what is the GCD of 12 and 18? Well the GCD is 6, because 6 divides both 12 and 18, and it's the largest number that divides both 12 and 18. Now there is an important fact about GCD's in particular, if I give you two numbers, two integers X and Y, there will always exist two other integers, I will call them A and B, such that if I look at a times X + B times Y what I get is the GCD of X and Y. In other words the GCD of X and Y is a linear combination of X and Y using the integers A and B. So far let us look at a simple example, here, let's look at the GCD from before, so the integers for the GCD would be 2 times 12 Minus 1 times 18. That's 24 minus 18, which is equal to 6. So the integers A and B in this case would be 2 and -1 But this is just an example, and in fact, these integers, A and B will exist for any integers, X and Y. Now not only do A and B exist, in fact there's a very simple and efficient algorithm to find these integers, to find A and B. The algorithm is what's called the extended Euclidean algorithm. This is actually one of the prettiest algorithms from ancient Greek times, due to Euclid of course. I'm not gonna show you how this algorithm works here, I. It's a fairly simple algorithm. I'll just tell that in fact given X and Y, this algorithm will find A and B in time roughly quadratic in the logarithms of X and Y. We'll come back to that and discuss the, the performance of Euclid's algorithm I have a bit more detail in just a minute. But, for now all we need to know is that A and B can actually be found efficiently. Now, if the GCD of X and Y happens to be 1. In other words, 1 is the largest integer that divides both X and Y, then we say that X and Y are relatively prime. For example, the GCD of three and five, it's not difficult to see that it hap, that happens to be 1, Because both 3 and 5 are prime.\n",

    "* The next topic we need to talk about is modulated inversion. So other than rationals we know what the inverse of a number is. In other words if I give you the number 2 the inverse of 2 is simply the fraction one half. the qestion is what about inverses when we, we work module N. Well, so the inverse of an element X in Z N is simply another element Y in Z N such that X times Y is equal to 1 in Z N. In other words X times Y is equal to 1 modulo N. And this number Y is denoted by X inverse. And it's not difficult to see that if, if Y exists, then in fact it's unique. And as I said, we'll use X inverse to denote the inverse of X. So let's look at a quick example. Suppose N is some odd integer, and I ask you what is the inverse of 2 in ZN? So it's not too difficult to see that the inverse of two in ZN in fact is N plus one over 2 and you can see that this is an integer because N is odd, therefore, N+1 is even and, therefore, (N+1)/2 is in fact an integer and the range 1..N as required. Now why is (N+1)/2 the inverse of two? Well, let's just multiply the 2 so we do 2 times (N+1) over 2 and what do we get? Well, that's simply equal to N+1 and N+1 is simply equal to 1 in ZN. So since their product is equal to 1. We know that (N+1)/2 is the inverse of 2 in ZN. \n",

    "* Now we understand what a modular inverse is, the question is which elements actually have an inverse in ZN? And so there's a very simple lemma that says that if for an element X in ZN, that element has an inverse if and only if it is relatively prime to the modulus N, to the number N. So I'll say that again. X and ZN is invertible if and only if X is relatively prime to N. And let's quickly prove that. It's actually fairly simple to see. So suppose a GCD of X and N happens to be equal to one. So X is relatively prime to N. Well, by this property of GCD as we know that there exists integers A and B. Such that A times X plus B times N is equal to the GCD of X and N, which happens to be one. So A times X plus B times N is equal to 1. Now we can actually take this equation here and, and us it reduce it's modulo N. So what this means is that a times X is equal to one in Z, N. Once we reduce this equation modulo N this term simply falls off because B times N is divisible by N and therefore is 0 modulo N. But what we just showed is that in fact X inverse is simply A in ZN. So because X is relatively prime to N, we were able to show that X is invertible by actually building the inverse of X modulo N Now what about the other direction? What happens if the GCD is greater than 1? Then we want to show that there is no inverse. But that's actually very easy to see because in this case, if you claim that A happens to be the inverse of X modulo N, well, let's look at a<i>x; a<i>X we know should be equal to 1 modulo N</i></i> But if the GCD(X,N) is bigger than 1, then the GCD(a<i>X,N)</i> is bigger than one. But, if the GCD of A times X and N is bigger than 1, then it's not possible that A<i>X is equal to 1. So A<i>X must also be</i></i> bigger than 1, and therefore, A cannot be the inverse of X module N. So this proves that, in fact, in, when the GCD is greater than 1, X cannot have an inverse, because there is no A, such that A times X is equal to one modulo N And this might be a bit confusing, so you might be best just to, do an example. So let's look at, let's suppose that the GCD of X and N happens to be equal to 2. I claim that X is therefore, is not invertible modular N. Well, why is that true? Well, for all A, we know that A times X is gonna be even, is even. And the reason we know that is because, well, 2 divides X and 2 divides N. Well, since two divide X, 2 is also gonna divide A times X. And therefore, A times X must be even. But what that means is that there's no way that A times X is equal to 1 modulo N In particular, there's no way that A times X is equal to B times N + 1 This simply can't happen, this equality must not hold. Because this side happens to be even, as we said. B times N for exactly the same reason is also even: N is divisible by two; therefore B times N is also divisible by two. So therefore B times N+1 is odd. And since even can't equal to odd, it's not possible that A times X is equal to some multiple of N+1. And in particular this means that A cannot be the inverse of X because A times X cannot be 1 mod N so X is not invertible modular N. So now we have a complete understanding of what are the invertible elements. Basically, we know that an element is invertible if and only if it's relatively prime to N. And what I like about this proof is I would say this is what's called a computer-science proof In the sense that not only does it prove to you that the inverse exists; it also shows you how to efficiently calculate the inverse. And the way we calculate the inverse, is basically by using this extending decreasing algorithm. Define the numbers A and B. And once we found the numbers A and B, we done because A is the inverse of X. And the numbers A and B can be found very efficiently. So along the way I've also shown you an algorithm for inverting elements, modulo N.\n",

We know that of the integers from zero to p-1, all of them are gonna be relatively primed to p except one integer--namely, the integer 0. Zero is not relatively primed to P, because the GCD(p,0)=0, not 1. So therefore, if p is a prime, the set ZP is simply ZP minus 0, Which means that everything in Z<u>P is invertible</u> except for 0.

Now we said that ZN is a set of integers from zero to N-1 and we said that we can add and multiply elements in the set modulo N. We also said that ZN star is basically the set of invertible elements in ZN. And we proved a simple lemma to say that, X is invertible if and only if X is relatively prime to N. And not only did we completely understand which elements are invertible and which aren't, we also showed a very efficient algorithm based on Euclid's extended algorithm, to find the inverse of an element X in ZN.

    "* So Fermat did a number of important theorems. The one that I want to show you here today is the following. So suppose I give you a prime P. Then in fact for any element X in ZP star, it so happens that if I look at X and raise it to the power of P - 1, I'm a gonna get one, in ZP. So let's look at a quick example. Suppose I set the number P to be five. And I look at, three to the power of P-1. In other words, three to the power of four, Three to the power of four is 81, which in fact, is one modulo five. This example satisfies Fermat's theorem.\n",
    "* Suppose I look at an element X in Z P star. And I want to remind you here that P must be a prime. Well, then what do we know? We know that X to the P minus one is equal to one. Well, we can write X to the P minus one as X times X to the power of P minus two. Well so now we know that X times X to the power of P minus two happens to be equal to one. And what that says, is that really the inverse of X modulo P, is simply X to the P minus two. So this gives us another algorithm for finding the inverse of X modulo a prime. Simply raise X to the power of p minus two, and that will give us the inverse of x. It turns out, actually this is a fine way to compute inverses modulo a prime. But it has two deficiencies compared to Euclid's algorithm. First of all, it only works modulo primes, Whereas, Euclid's algorithm worked modulo composites as well. And second of all, it turns out this algorithm is actually less efficient.\n",

    "* So let me show you a quick and simple application for Fermat's theorem suppose we wanted to generate a large random prime, say our prime needed to be 1,000 bits or so. So the prime we're looking for is on the order of two to the 1024 . So here's a very simple probabilistic algorithm. What we would do is we would choose a random integer in the interval that was specified. And then we would test whether this integer satisfies Fermat's theorem. In other words, we would test for example using the base two; we would test whether two to the power of p minus one equals one in Z p. If the answer is no, then if this equality doesn't hold, then we know for sure that the number p that we chose is not a prime. And if that happens, all we do is we go back to step one and we try another prime. And we do this again and again and again, until finally we find an integer that satisfies this condition. And once we find an integer that satisfies this condition, we simply output it and stop. Now it turns out, this is actually a fairly difficult statement to prove. But it turns out if a random number passes this test, then it's extremely likely to be a prime. In particular the probability that P is not a prime is very small. It's like less than two to the -60 for the range of 1024 bit numbers. As the number gets bigger and bigger the probability that it passes this test here, but is not a prime drops to zero very quickly\n",

    "* And one of the first things Euler showed is in modern language is that ZP star is what's called a cyclic group. What does it mean that ZP star is a cyclic group? What it means is that there exists some element G in ZP star, such that if we take G and raise to a bunch of powers G, G squared, G cubed, G to the fourth. And so on and so forth up until we reach G to the P minus two. Notice there's no point of going beyond G to the p minus two, because G to the p minus one by Fermat's theorem is equal to one, so then we will cycle back to one. If we go back to G to the p minus one, then G to the p will be equal to G, G to the p plus one will be equal to G squared, and so on and so forth. So we'll actually get a cycle if we keep raising to higher and higher powers of G. So we might as well stop at the power of G to the p minus two. And what Euler showed is that in fact there is an element G such that if you look at all of its powers all of its powers expand the entire group ZP Star. The powers of G give us all the elements in ZP star. Elements of this, of this type is called a generator. So G would be said to be a generator of ZP star. So let's look at a quick example. So let's look, for example, at P equals seven. And let's look at all the powers of three. So three squared three cubed, three to the fourth, three to the fifth, Three to the six, already we know, is equal to one modular seven by Fermat's Theorem. So there's no point in looking at three to the six. We know we would just get one. So here, I calculated all these powers for you, and I wrote them out. And you see that in fact, we get all the numbers in Z, in Z7 star. In other words, we get one, two, three, four, five, and six. So we would say that three is a generator of Z7 star.\n",

    "* Okay, it's basically the smallest power that causes the power of G to be equal to one. And it's very easy to see that this equality here basically if we look at all the powers of G and we look at one, G, G squared, G cubed and so on and so forth up until we get to G to the order of G minus one. And then if we look at the order of G to the order of G. This thing is simply going to be equal to one, by definition. Okay, so there's no point in looking at any higher powers. We might as well just stop raising to powers here. And as a result the size of the set, in fact, is the order of G. And you can see that the order is the smallest power such that raising G to that power gives us one in Z p. So I hope this is clear although it might take a little bit of thinking to absorb all this notation. But in the meantime let's look at a few examples. So, again, let's fix our, our prime to be seven. And let's look at the order of the number of elements. So what is the order of three modulus of seven? Well, we're asking what is the size of the group that three generates modulus of seven? Well, we said that three is a generator of Z7 star. So it generates all of Z7 star. There are six elements in Z7 star. And therefore we say that the order of three is equal to six. Similarly, I can ask, well, what is the order of two modulo seven? And in fact, we already saw the answer.\n",

    "* So what I wanna show you here is what's called Euler's Theorem which is a, a direct generalization of Fermat's Theorem. So, Euler defined the following function. So given an integer N, he defined what's called the phi function, phi of M, to be basically the size of the set ZN star. This is sometimes called, Euler's phi function. The size of the set Z N star. So for example, we already looked at Z twelve star. We said that Z twelve star contains these four elements, one, five, seven, and eleven. And therefore we say that phi of twelve is simply the number four. So let me ask you as a puzzle, what is phi of P? It will basically be the size of Z P star. And so, in fact, we said that in the Z P star contains all of Z P except for the number zero. And therefore, phi of P for any prime P is gonna be P minus one. Now, there is a special case, which I'm gonna state here and we're gonna use later for the RSA system. If N happens to be a product of two primes, then phi of N is simply N minus P minus Q plus one. And let me just show you why that's true. So basically N is the size of Z N. And now we need to remove all the elements that are not relatively prime to m. Well how can an element not be relatively prime to m? It's gotta be divisible by p or it's gotta be divisible by q. Well how many elements between zero and m minus one are there, there that are divisible by p? Well there are exactly q of them. How many elements are there that are divisible by q. Well there are exactly p of them. So we subtract p to get rid of those divisible by q. We subtract q to get rid of those divisible by p. And you notice we subtracted zero twice, because zero is divisible both by P and Q. And therefore, we add one just to make sure we subtract zero only once. And so it's not difficult to see that phi(N) is N-P-Q+1. And another way of writing that is simply (P-1) times (Q-1). Okay, so this is a fact that we will use later on, when we come back and talk about the RSA system. So far, this is just defining this phi function of Euler. But now Euler put this phi function to really good use. And what he proved is this amazing fact here that basically says that if you give me any element X in Z N star. In fact, and it so happens that X to the power of phi(N) is equal to one in Z N. So you can see that this is a generalization of Fermat's theorem; in particular, Fermat's theorem only applied to primes. For primes we know that phi(p) is equal to p minus one, and in other words if N were prime we would simply write p minus one here, and then we would get exactly Fermat's theorem. The beauty of Euler's theorem is that it applies to composites, and not just primes. So let's look at some examples. So let's look at five to the power of phi(12). So five is an element of Z12 star. If we raise it to the power of five of twelve, we should be getting one. Well, we know that phi(12) is 4, so we're raising 5 to the power of 4. Five to the power of four is 625 and it's a simple calculation to show that that's equal to 1 modulo 12. So this is proof by example but of course it's not a proof at all. It's just an example. But in fact it's not difficult to prove Euler's theorem and in fact I'll tell you that Euler's theorem is also a very special case of Lagrange's general theorem. Okay so we say that this is a generalization of Fermat's theorem and in fact as we'll see this Euler's theorem is the basis of the RSA crypto system"

So the solution is minus b plus minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac over 2a. And I claim that you know how to compute all the elements in this formula. So you know how to compute the inverse of 2a. So you can divide by 2a. That's done using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

    "* So the first question is how do we represent large integers in a computer? So that's actually fairly straightforward. So imagine we're on a 64 bit machine, what we would do is we would break the number we want to represent, into 32 bit buckets And then, we will basically have these n/32 bit buckets, and together they will represent the number that we want to store on the computer. Now, I should mention that I'm only giving 64 bit registers as an example. In fact, many modern processors have 128 bit registers or more, and you can even do multiplications on them. So normally you would actually use much larger blocks than just 32 bits. The reason, by the way, you want to limit yourself to 32 bits is so that you can multiply two blocks together, and the result will still be less than 64 bits, less than the word size on the machine.\n",

    "* So there's actually quite a bit known about the factoring problem. It's actually a very old problem. Already the Greeks were interested in factoring, but Gauss actually has a wonderful, wonderful quote that talks about the problem of factoring and the problem of primality testing. So in his famous dissertation from 1805, he writes: \"The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers\" (this is what's called primality testing) \"and the problem of resolving the latter\" (namely composites) \"into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic.\" So he had the foresight to realize that these are extremely interesting problems. These are computer science problems essentially. How do we test if a number is prime? How do we factor a number if it's not a prime, if it's a composite? And already Gauss realized that these are extremely extremely important and interesting problems, and now, these days, these problems are actually used on the Web all over the place. So let's see. So, in fact, testing if a number is prime has been completely solved; we now know completely how to do it, using, efficiently using a randomized algorithm, and we even know how to do it using a deterministic algorithm. Factoring numbers, factoring composites into their prime factors, is still believed to be a difficult problem. I would encourage you actually to think about it. It's a wonderful problem to think about. If any of you can solve it, if any of you can come up with an algorithm to factor composites into prime factors, again, as I said, it's instant fame in the crypto world, and it would have tremendous impact on security of the Web in general. So it's a fun problem to think about. Let me tell you what's known about the problem of factoring. So the best algorithm that we have is called the number field sieve. Again, its running time is one of these exponentials, but a cube root of an exponential, which is why the composite has to be quite large for the problem to be difficult. Although the current world record is really just factoring a 768-bit number. This is called the RSA-768 number, it's a challenge number that was recently factored. The number is about 200 digits, and already factoring this number took an enormous amount of work. It took about two years on hundreds of machines, and finally they were able to factor this number. And the estimate is that actually factoring a 1024-bit number is about 1000 times harder than factoring RSA-768, so instead of 2 years, it would take two thousand years but of course computers are getting faster, we have more cores at our disposal, we have more computers, and so this factor of 1000, assuming Moore's Law and so on, really just means a decade—you know, computers get faster by about a factor of 1000 every decade, so it's very likely that within the next decade, we'll see a factorization of a 1024-bit number, which would be the end of 1024 bits being used for public-key cryptography. So that's the state of the art in the factoring world, and this concludes this module."
