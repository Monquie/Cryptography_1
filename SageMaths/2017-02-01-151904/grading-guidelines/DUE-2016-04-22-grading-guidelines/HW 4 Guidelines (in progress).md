# <font color='red'>50 points total (10 points per problem)</font>

<font color='green'>Please put grades in a Markdown file with deductions listed out for each problem and the points for each problem. Award 0 points for blank responses.</font>
</br>

### For all problems:
Only deduct points from any single bullet point once. Unless otherwise specified.

### Problem 1: 10 Points
See answer-1.tex in the folder answer-1/.
Another acceptable solution would be to have copied lorem ipsum manually.
</br>
#### <font color='red'>Deduct:</font>
- 3 points if it compiles with errors
- 2 points if they don't have the lorem ipsum text
- 2 points if they don't have the foot note hint
- 1 point if they didn't use \LaTeX
- 1 point if they foot note hint isn't attached to the title.

### Problem 2: 10 Points
See answer-2.tex in the folder answer-2/ for a sample solution.
</br>
#### <font color='red'>Deduct:</font>
- 2 points if the equations are not aligned with the text being left aligned. It doesn't matter what alignment environment they used. It also doesn't matter how much space there is between the columns.
- 2 points if it compiles with errors
- 2 points if they didn't have the two enumerate environments
- 1 points if they don't have the foot note hint
- 1 points for egregious differences in formating. (ie. centered equations are were left aligned)
- 2 points if they made 2 or more errors not specified above in the content of their pdf.
 - This is different from the presentation/formatting.
 - eg. **<font color='red'>Do not</font>** deduct these points for egregious spacing errors

### Problem 3: 10 Points
</br>
#### <font color='red'>Deduct:</font>
- 2 points if it compiles with errors
- 2 points if they did not factor using sage
- 2 points if they did not plot $\sin(x^2)$
 - 1 point if, in your opinion, their plot is ginormous.
- 2 points if they did not use a sageblock for part 3
- 1 point if they did not plot the function in part 3
- 1 points if they made 2 or more other typos in the content of their pdf.

### Problem 4: 10 Points
Their solution to this problem should be very similar to the solution since the majority of the document source was provided. For this problem, use the command line to diff their TeX file with the solution TeX file and use your best judgement on grading. For example, don't deduct for differences like having corrected "Intruduction" to "Introduction" or for slight differences in the LaTeX that compile to the same output.
</br>
#### <font color='red'>Deduct:</font>
- 2 points for each error it compiles with.

### Problem 5: 10 Points
#### <font color='red'>Deduct:</font>
- 8 points if it compiles with any errors
- 2 point if the tex seems basic or extremely dull
